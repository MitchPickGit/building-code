parts. Affected parts of buildings may be in buildings that 
pre-date the commencement on 1 May 2011 of the access 
provisions in the BCA Volume One or they may be in 
buildings constructed after 1 May 2011.

was issued before or after 1 May 2011.

amended by the insertion of one or more subregulations, subrules or 
subclauses the original regulation, rule or clause becomes subregulation, 
subrule or subclause (1) and is amended by the insertion of the 
expression ""(1)"" at the beginning of the original regulation, rule or clause. 
Interpretation 
As from 1 January 2001, amendments to section 36 of the ILA have the 
following effects: 
• 
Headings 
All headings included in a Statutory Rule which is made on or after  
1 January 2001 form part of that Statutory Rule.  Any heading inserted in a 
Statutory Rule which was made before 1 January 2001, by a Statutory Rule 
made on or after 1 January 2001, forms part of that Statutory Rule.  
This includes headings to Parts, Divisions or Subdivisions in a Schedule; 
Orders; Parts into which an Order is divided; clauses; regulations; rules; 
items; tables; columns; examples; diagrams; notes or forms.   
See section 36(1A)(2A)(2B).

• 
Examples, diagrams or notes 
All examples, diagrams or notes included in a Statutory Rule which is made 
on or after 1 January 2001 form part of that Statutory Rule.  Any examples, 
diagrams or notes inserted in a Statutory Rule which was made before 
1 January 2001, by a Statutory Rule made on or after 1 January 2001, form 
part of that Statutory Rule.  See section 36(3A). 
• 
Punctuation 
All punctuation included in a Statutory Rule which is made on or after  
1 January 2001 forms part of that Statutory Rule.  Any punctuation inserted 
in a Statutory Rule which was made before 1 January 2001, by a Statutory 
Rule made on or after 1 January 2001, forms part of that Statutory Rule.  
See section 36(3B). 
• 
Provision numbers 
All provision numbers included in a Statutory Rule form part of that 
Statutory Rule, whether inserted in the Statutory Rule before, on or after  
1 January 2001.  Provision numbers include regulation numbers, rule 
numbers, subregulation numbers, subrule numbers, paragraphs and 
subparagraphs.  See section 36(3C). 
• 
Location of ""legislative items"" 
A ""legislative item"" is a penalty, an example or a note.  As from 13 October 
2004, a legislative item relating to a provision of a Statutory Rule is taken to 
be at the foot of that provision even if it is preceded or followed by another 
legislative item that relates to that provision.  For example, if a penalty at the 
foot of a provision is followed by a note, both of these legislative items will 
be regarded as being at the foot of that provision.  See section 36B. 
• 
Other material 
Any explanatory memorandum, table of provisions, endnotes, index and 
other material printed after the Endnotes does not form part of a Statutory 
Rule.  See section 36(3)(3D)(3E)."
