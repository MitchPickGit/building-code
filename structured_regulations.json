Any heading inserted in a \nStatutory Rule which was made before 1 January 2001, by a Statutory Rule \nmade on or after 1 January 2001, forms part of that Statutory Rule.  \nThis includes headings to Parts, Divisions or Subdivisions in a Schedule; \nOrders; Parts into which an Order is divided; clauses; regulations; rules; \nitems; tables; columns; examples; diagrams; notes or forms.   \nSee section 36(1A)(2A)(2B). \n \n \n \n \nAuthorised by the Chief Parliamentary Counsel \nEndnotes \n \n \n \nBuilding Regulations 2018 \nS.R.

As from 13 October \n2004, a legislative item relating to a provision of a Statutory Rule is taken to \nbe at the foot of that provision even if it is preceded or followed by another \nlegislative item that relates to that provision.  For example, if a penalty at the \nfoot of a provision is followed by a note, both of these legislative items will \nbe regarded as being at the foot of that provision.  See section 36B. \n• \nOther material \nAny explanatory memorandum, table of provisions, endnotes, index and \nother material printed after the Endnotes does not form part of a Statutory \nRule.
